Templates
===========

Welcome to the template repository. These templates are the starting-point for Amnesty International Content. 

Templates are made up of two sections: a [metadata](https://github.com/AmnestyInternational/ContentKit/wiki/Introduction-to-Metadata) header and a [Markdown](https://github.com/AmnestyInternational/ContentKit/wiki/Introduction-to-Markdown) formatted body. 

Content in the templates (especially the header) is seperated into "chunks;" peices of content that can be quickly and easily recycled accross a wide range of platforms. As illustrated in the example below, from the "post" template, everything _between_ the dashed `---` lines is the post's metadata header. Everything _after_ the dashed lines is the page content of the post:

    ---
    published: 
    publication-date:
    update-date:
    author: 
    title: 
    title-short-version: 
    subtitle: 
    teaser: 
    mini-teaser: 
    categories: 
    topics: 
    keywords: 
    cover-image-URL:
    audio-file-URL:
    video-file-URL:
    ---
    
    This area is were the body copy goes.

    Here is another paragraph.

See "[Getting started](https://github.com/AmnestyInternational/ContentKit/wiki#getting-started)" in the Wiki for tutorials on using the templates.
