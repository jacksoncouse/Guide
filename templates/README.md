Templates
===========

Welcome to the template repository. These templates are the starting-point for Amnesty International Content. 

Templates are made up of two sections: a YAML header and a Markdown body. Content in the templates is seperated into "chunks;" peices of content that can be quickly and easily recycled accross a wide range of platforms. As illustrated in the example below, everything _between_ the dashed lines is header and everything _after_ the dashed lines is the page content of the post:

    ---
    published: true
    author: jsmith
    short-title: "The title of this story that will be shown on cramped platforms"
    long-title: "The title of this story that will be shown on plaforms with room"
    subtitle: "The secondary title of this story"
    short-summary: "The summary of this story that will be shown on cramped platforms"
    long-summary: "The summary of this story that will be shown on plaforms with room"
    categories: blog
    topics: "dash-seperated-values-of-blog-categories, another-dashed-category"
    seo-keywords: "human rights, Canada, licorice"
    layout: blog

    This area is were the body copy goes.

See "[Getting started](https://github.com/AmnestyInternational/ContentKit/wiki#getting-started)" in the Wiki for tutorials about how to write content using the templates.
