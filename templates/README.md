Templates
===========

Welcome to the template repository. These templates are the starting-point for Amnesty International Content. 

Templates are made up of two sections: a YAML header and a Markdown body. Content in the templates is seperated into "chunks;" peices of content that can quickly and easily be recycled accross a wide range of platforms. As illustrated in the example below, everything between the lines is header and everything after the lines is the page content of the post:

'

<span>---</span>
published: true
author: jsmith
short-title: "The title of this story that will be shown on cramped platforms"
long-title: "The title of this story that will be shown on plaforms with room"
subtitle: "The secondary title of this story"
short-summary: "The summary of this story that will be shown on cramped platforms"
long-summary: "The summary of this story that will be shown on plaforms with room"
categories: blog
topics: "dash-seperated-values-of-blog-categories, another-dashed-category"
seo-keywords: "human rights, Canada, licorice"
layout: blog
<span>---</span>

This area is were the body copy goes.
