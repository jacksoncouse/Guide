Templates
===========

Welcome to the template repository. These templates are the starting-point for Amnesty International Content. 

Templates are made up of two sections: a YAML header and a Markdown body. Content in the templates is seperated into "chunks;" peices of content that can be quickly and easily recycled accross a wide range of platforms. As illustrated in the example below, fron the "post" template, everything _between_ the dashed lines is the post's metadata header. Everything _after_ the dashed lines is the page content of the post:
