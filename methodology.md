Methodology
==========================

## Philosophy

The philosophical foundations of Amnesty International Canada's content strategy are based on:
- [Create Once, Publish Everywhere](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/10/13/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/) (COPE), an extension on the programmer's maxim of "don't repeat yourself" to the digital publishing context
- [Lossless, Open, Flexible, Independant](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/stolley/) (LO-FI), a set of values for creating content parity across all platforms

## Technology

The technical foundations of our publishing ecosystem are simple, yet powerful, standard systems:
- [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/), a format for writing metadata (contextual information) designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages
- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that converts easily to HTML (and other formats).
- [File System as Information Management](http://dougist.com/2009/08/file-system-infobase-manager/), a platform-independant method of organizing digital assets
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/), a version control system
- Project [LaForge](https://github.com/AmnestyInternational/LaForge), the Amnesty International Canada app development template (currently in development)
