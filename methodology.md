## Philosophy

The philosophical foundations of Amnesty International's content strategy are based on:
- Create Once, Publish Everywhere (COPE)
- Lossless, Open, Flexible, Independant (LO-FI)

## Technology

The technical foundations of our publishing ecosystem are simple, yet powerful, standard systems:
- YAML, a format for writing metadata (contextual information) designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages
- Markdown, an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that converts easily to HTML (and other formats).
- File System as Information Management, a platform-independant method of organizing digital assets
- Git, a version control system
