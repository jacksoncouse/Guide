Content Construction Kit
===================================

*Note, the CCK is currently under active development. Your contributions are welcome. Contact @jacksoncouse to get involved.*

## Introduction

The Content Construction Kit, or CCK, is a tool for digital publishing. 

The CCK establishes a foundation of best-practice principles and a system of digital production. It provides resources, standards, training, and access.

The goal of the CCK is the promotion, extension, and preservation of human rights through effective digital discourse. The CCK is built with the aim of progressive automation and enhancement of Amnesty International Canada's publishing workflow. It is meant to grow.

For writers, the CCK provides a clear publishing path: well documented requirements, openly stated strategic goals, helpful tutorials, a standardized submission process, and transparent revisions. Accountability between content creators and editors is a core aspect of the CCK method.

## Why?

Why work differently than you're used to? 

The demands of digital publishing scale exponentially, but _individual humans beings don't scale_. The net number of requests for publishing attention exceeds our ability to provide that attention. Our ability to respond thoughtfully to the material we do publish is extremely limited. The CCK is a way to scale and streamline the publishing process so that all of our material gets the attention it deserves. 

This is also a change in _mentality_:

_- Alberto Pepe_

The paper-paradigm is not appropriate for the internet. We need a 21st-century tool set. The CCK is a shift in the way we think about communications, publishing, and activism. It is a move toward open, collaborative, and accountable ways of working.

Building a movement takes many hands.
