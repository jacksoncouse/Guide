Content Construction Kit
===================================

## Overview

The _Content Construction Kit_, or CCK for short, is a resource for Amnesty International Canada writers, bloggers, and contributors. The CCK is an integral part of Amnesty International Canada's content strategy and the starting-point for our digital publishing work.

The CCK is a tool to establish of a foundation of resources and best-practice principles of digital production, and is built to allow for progressive automation of our publishing workflow. The goal of the CCK is the advancement, extension, and preservation of human rights through effective digital discourse.

For writers, the CCK provides a clear publishing path: well documented requirements, openly stated strategic goals, helpful tutorials, a standardized submission process, and a transparent revision. Accountability between content craetors and editors is a core aspect of the CCK method.

*Note*, the CCK is currently under active development. This project will change and develop over time. Your contributions are welcomed and expected.
