Content Construction Kit
==========

### Introduction

The Content Construction Kit is a resource for Amnesty International Canada writers, bloggers, and contributors.
The CCK is an integral part of Amnesty International Canada's content strategy and the starting-point in our digital publishing workflow.

The philosophical foundations of Amnesty International's content strategy are based on:
- Create Once, Publish Everywhere (COPE)
- Lossless, Open, Flexible, Independant (LO-FI)

The technical foundations of our publishing ecosystem are two simple, yet powerful, standard systems:
- YAML, a format for writing metadata (contextual information) designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages
- Markdown, an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that converts easily to HTML (and other formats)
