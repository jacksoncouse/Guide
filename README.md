Content Construction Kit
===================================

## Introduction

### Publishing is about _people_

The demands of digital publishing scale exponentially, but _individual humans beings don't scale_. We will never have less data, less to publish, less to keep updated, or less new technologcal devices to publish to, than we do today. Every day there is more to do. This is a big challenge, but its also a fantastic opportunity.

For some time, our online publishing demands have exceed our capacity. The requests upon us for publishing attention are more than we can handle, both in volume and technical complexity. We do not have the time or resources to respond thoughtfully to all the material we are asked to publish. As a result, the material we do publish is limited, inadequate, and frequently out of date or wrong. 

We built the Content Construction Kit to address this. Its not a solution, but it is a start. Our hope is that by normalizing and streamlining the publishing process we can make things easier. We want all of our material to get the attention it deserves.

In the short run, we can't add more publishing resources. The only way for us to increase our efficiency is to share the work load. The Content Construction Kit moves limited publishing responsibilities out of the hands of a few and onto us all. This isn't a new idea - as you know, building a movement takes many hands. 

### Publishing is about _outlook_

The Content Construction Kit is also a change in _mentality_. Today, ["we do 21st-century research, write it up using 20th century tools, and then package it into 17th century formats.‚Äù](http://facilitatingchange.org/2012/11/failfaire-dc-publishing/). This is not a sustainable approach to online publishing.

We have been opperating under the paper-paradigm for far too long. It is just not appropriate for publishing to the internet, for a variety of [reasons](/docs/). We desperately need a 21st-century approach to publishing, not just for effeciency, but for relevance, authority, and growth. The CCK is this shift, toward more open, collaborative, and accountable ways of working. 

We do not choose the devices people use to access our content. If we do not change to meet the demands of new technolog (today mostly mobile devices) we risk alientating the very people we seek to serve. The CCK is a move towards publishing content that can be distributed anywhere, from text messages to TV screens. 

For content creators, the Content Construction Kit establishes a clear and open path to participating in publishing online: well documented requirements, specificly stated strategic goals, helpful tutorials, process, accountability, and transparency. It provides resources, standards, training, and access. It is the foundation of an open system of digital production. 

### Publishing is about _speaking the voice of a movement_

The Content Construction Kit is also the starting point for evaluating the effectiveness of our work online. How well do we communicate? Are our messages clear? Is our story being heard? Are we effective in educating, agitating, and facilitating change? To answer these questions, we need a clear reference point. The CCK isn't just a manual, it is a forum for discussion, debate, growth, and change. 

Ultimately, the goal of the CCK is to support Amnesty International Canada's work. It is a methodology for promotion, extension, and preservation of human rights through effective digital discourse. 

Finallym the CCK is built with the aim of progressive automation and enhancement of Amnesty International Canada's publishing workflow. It is a collaborative open source project, meant to grow with contributions from its users. Please take part, this tool is built for you.
