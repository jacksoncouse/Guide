## Subject Classification

The Content Contruction Kit uses a controlled vocabulary based on the HURIDOCS [Standard Format](http://www.huridocs.org/resource/huridocs-events-standard-formats/) and [Micro-Thesauri](http://www.huridocs.org/resource/micro-thesauri/) system to classify human rights documents and ideas. 

The goal of this system is imporved access to information and exposure of human rights issues by using a standardized vocabulary to talk about human rights violations.

At the core of the CCK's subject classification system is a categorization of each subject, sub-theme, and sub-topic of human rights using a 'violations' model. 

Each subject, sub-theme, and topic category has a unique numerical identifier.

## File Classification

The CCK uses file-naming conventions to classify and organize documents and files.

The goal of this system is document portability and long-term sustainabilty. Based on the [File System Infobase Manager](http://dougist.com/2009/08/file-system-infobase-manager/) technique, the basis of CCK's digital asset management strategy is metadata embedded into the file name.

The core of the CCK asset management strategy is a heirarchy of content area, package, and asset profiles. Like the HRUIDOCS system, the file classification system uses unique alpha-numerical codes to segment digital files by type.
