## The Catalogue

The catalogue organizes our public communications by idea, type, and time. The catalogue puts all of the atoms in all their correct places.

Think of a graph. On one axis, we plot all of the ideas we communicate about in our human rights work. On another axis, we plot all of the different kinds of communications products we produce. On the third axis, we plot time. This is how the CCK catalogue works: we organize and encode include all of our publishing work, each and every story classified, filed, and, most imprortantly, *related to one another*. By catalogueing our stories we make them searchable, dynamic, and relevant. 

### Subject Classification

The CCK will use a metadata system based on the HURIDOCS [Standard Format](http://www.huridocs.org/resource/huridocs-events-standard-formats/) [Micro-Thesauri](http://www.huridocs.org/resource/micro-thesauri/) to classify human rights ideas and attach those ideas to documents. This system uses a "violations" model and unique numerical identifier to classify human rights issues.

The purpose adopting of this system is to create a standardized, open, and complete vocabulary for classifying human rights violations, thereby increaing access to information and exposure of human rights issues.

_This system is currently under construction._ See [@jacksoncouse](https://github.com/jacksoncouse) and [@wiki-d](https://github.com/wiki-d) to get involved.
