Business Rules 
==================================================

Organization is an important part of Amnesty International Canada's content strategy. This section of the CCK describes how we organize our content.

## The Story

The story is the basic unit - the _"atom"_ - and organizing principle of our content system. A story can be told in many different ways, but the story is always the genesis of the need to publish. 

### Story packages

Like an atom, a story is a complete unit made up of a few simple parts that combine and relate to one another. The three parts of a complete story package are:

1. Ideas
1. Context
1. Assets

#### Ideas: [the catalogue]((/rules/catalogue.md)

The [catalogue](/rules/catalogue.md) is a method for classifying our stories. It is vocabulary of _human rights ideas_ that we attach to our stories with metadata. We use the catalogue to identify the ideas in our stories in a standardized way.

By using metadata, the catalogue allows us to organize our _human rights ideas_ seperately from our _human rights work_ (the Critical Pathways and Canada Priorities). This means we can keep our content organized even when our priorities and our work changes. It is also an essential part of making our website searchable.

#### Context: file naming conventions

Naming things is one of the hardest things to do in computer science, and it gets especially tricky when many different people and machines are involved. The system we use is based on a simple, but strict, [file-naming conventions](/rules/file-names.md).

Properly naming things tells the publisher what the parts of your story are and where they belong.

#### Assets: [file formats](/rules/formats)

Assets are the components of a story. These peices include text documents, metadata, images, and so on. [File formats](/rules/formats) defines allowable file types for stories. 

## [Roles](/rules/roles.md)

Different people have different responsibilities and levels of direct access to publishing. We have a set of [roles](/rules/roles.md) to define these relationships.
